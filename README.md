## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate **AI/ML Engineer** with a strong foundation in **Data Science**, currently pushing the boundaries of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. My work revolves around building intelligent systems that learn, adapt, and solve real-world problems. When I'm not training models, I'm either diving into research papers or contributing to open-source projects.

## 🔥 Current Focus

- **🔬 Research:** Exploring cutting-edge techniques in **LLMs** (efficiency, fine-tuning, alignment) and **GANs** (stability, multi-modal generation).  
- **🚀 Projects:** Building scalable AI solutions for **enterprise automation, creative content generation, and domain-specific language models**.  
- **📊 Data Science:** Solving complex problems with data-driven insights and predictive modeling.

## 📫 Let's Collaborate!

I'm always excited to:  
- 🤝 **Collaborate** on research or open-source projects.  
- 💡 **Discuss** ideas about AI, LLMs, or generative models.  
- 🚀 **Build** innovative tools that push the boundaries of AI.  

**Fun fact:** I once trained a GAN to generate portraits of historical figures... and accidentally turned LeBron James into a glitched-out, neon-drenched cyber-athlete. (Latent space doesn’t respect NBA dress codes.).
