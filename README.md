## 🧠 About Me  

I'm a passionate **AI/ML Engineer** and **AI Agent Specialist** with deep expertise in **prompt engineering, autonomous systems, and LLM orchestration**. My work focuses on building **highly adaptive AI agents**, optimizing prompt-driven workflows, and pushing the boundaries of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Generative AI**.  

With extensive experience in **designing, fine-tuning, and deploying AI agents** for complex tasks, I bridge the gap between research and real-world applications. When I'm not engineering prompts or debugging agentic loops, I contribute to open-source AI projects or write about emergent AI behaviors.

## 🏆 AI Agent & Prompt Engineering Expertise  

- Designed **autonomous AI agents** for workflow automation, reducing manual tasks by **70%+**  
- Built **custom prompt frameworks** for domain-specific LLMs (legal, medical, creative writing)  
- Optimized **RAG pipelines** for accuracy and latency-critical applications  
- Trained **self-improving agentic systems** using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)

## 📫 Let's Collaborate!  

I'm always excited to:  
- 🤝 **Collaborate** on **AI agent projects** or **prompt engineering challenges**  
- 💡 **Discuss** LLM alignment, multi-agent systems, or emergent AI behaviors  
- 🚀 **Build** the next generation of **autonomous, ethical AI tools**  

**Fun fact:** I once trained an AI agent to negotiate with other LLMs—it ended up bartering Python code for API credits in a simulated economy. (Turns out GPT-4 is a ruthless trader.)
